# Tailwind-static


## Motivation
While  working on a legacy project was looking for a way to add Tailwind CSS to the project without the need to install the whole package.

## Recommended way

The official  [recommended option is from a CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn).


## Problems

I don't like it for several reasons, mainly that I don't have autocomplete options in my IDE, and that I don't want to add another CDN To the site.

## Optional solution

This repo is a simple way to add Tailwind CSS to your project without the need to install the whole package.
You can use the `tailwind.css` and compile only some utils classes. 

Use it only if there is no other option.

## How to use it

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`
